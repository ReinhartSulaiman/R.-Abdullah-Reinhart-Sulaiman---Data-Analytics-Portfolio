# Data Analytics Portfolio of R. Abdullah Reinhart Sulaiman
Hello, my name is R. Abdullah Reinhart Sulaiman. You can call me **Reinhart** or Rein for short, if you want.
This is my portfolio as Data Analyst, I'm still learning, so please have a look!

# Spreadsheet skillsets:
I choose to use Google Sheets and Microsoft Excel as my preference of data manipulation software.
- Data cleaning
- Pivot table
- Vlookup and Hlookup
- Descriptive statistics
- Data visualization
- Information and insight generation
- Hypothesis testing (A/B testing)

Here is an [example](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1jcHgtlt0jr78Qwenxm3v6D5ltf0rRJ-BebHOoKvPedA/edit#gid=420626643) of what I do using spreadsheet.

# SQL skillsets:
I use Google BigQuery as my data manipulation software.
- Standard/basic query syntax
- Aggregate function
- Join table function
- Data type and datetime function

Here are some example of what I do using SQL:
  - [How to retrieves the count of delivered orders for each unique customer city between the specified date range](https://console.cloud.google.com/bigquery?sq=594081560594:1534bc1e2aa74c239ee83b722792d8cc). It uses an inner join between the orders_dataset and customers_dataset on the customer_id. The result is then grouped by the customer city, and the count of delivered orders is calculated. Finally, the result is ordered in descending order by the count of delivered orders, and only the top 100 rows are displayed.
  - [How to have counts of the number of delivered orders for each combination of city and month within the specified date range](https://console.cloud.google.com/bigquery?sq=594081560594:31c2e44c264d4d238bf7d46429c3aa44). The result is then ordered in ascending order by the count of delivered orders, and only the top 100 rows are displayed.
  - [How to calculate the total number of distinct customers for each product category for delivered orders within a specific date range](https://console.cloud.google.com/bigquery?sq=594081560594:30c10230c8de482ba5088fbac10edd99).  It uses left joins on the order_items_dataset, products_dataset, and orders_dataset. The result is then grouped by product category, and the total number of distinct customers is calculated. The final result is ordered in descending order by the total number of customers.

# Python skillsets:
I use Google Colaboratory as my data manipulation software.
- Data cleaning, including: changing data types, removing irrelevant values and duplicates, and removing or filling missing data
- Data manipulation, including: handling outlier(s) using IQR method, combine and merge datasets, and data aggregation
- Descriptive statistics
- Data visualization
- Hypothesis testing
- Cluster analysis

Here are some example of what I do using Python:
  - [An analysis of a case study](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1BcvLki42I-j_qaNTCcWJ4GrZDBQakrMd?usp=sharing), in which a European bank wants to increase the usage of credit cards in partnership with various merchants through an e-commerce marketplace company. I am acting as data analyst of the bank to understand spending patterns of the e-commerce customers, create ways to reduce promotional cost, and identify business opportunities to customize reward program for loyal customers.

# Data visualization skillsets:
I use Tableau as my data visualization software.
- Connect and combine datasets
- Data formatting
- Making new column using calculated field/formula
- Data visualization, including but not limited to: making scorecard, heatmap table, stacked bar chart, and map
- Interactive dashboard

Here are some example of what I do using Tableau:
  - An analysis of a case study, in which a video game distribution company wants to understand its customers by analyzing its sales performance. I am acting as data analyst of the company to understand the sales performance of the games sold in its app, looking for reviews of the games from the customers, and identify customer bases based on location.
    - This is the [part one](https://public.tableau.com/views/W9W10_SEP23_R_AbdullahReinhart_Sulaiman_intermediate_2/Dashboard2?:language=en-US&publish=yes&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link) of the two dashboards. This dashboard is filled with scorecards, simple statistics of the game sales performance, and a map representing the statistics of customer bases locations.  
    - This is the [part two](https://public.tableau.com/views/W9W10_SEP23_R_AbdullahReinhart_Sulaiman_intermediate_2/Dashboard2?:language=en-US&publish=yes&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link) of the two dashboards. This dashboard is filled with dual axis-line chart to represent growth over time and customer behavior across small groupings of customers.

# Project Based Analysis
With these skillsets, one must be able to put the skillsets into practice. This is my proof of work.
  - [An analysis of a case study](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1rXe9kt3BZalKydsaFTcEmJKAWpoxcX8v?usp=sharing), in which I act as a data analyst of a market research company, to analyze the dataset of the e-commerce industry of a whole nation (Pakistan, using an actual public dataset) of a certain time range. The goal of the analysis is to understand how to increase revenue of those companies, by using datasets filled with data from multiple companies, and provide a comprehensive analysis, which then I offer insights and recommendations generated from the analysis.
