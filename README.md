# List of Projects and Skill Sets Involved
### Spreadsheet skill sets:
I choose to use Google Sheets and Microsoft Excel as my preference of data manipulation software.
- Data cleaning
- Pivot table
- Vlookup and Hlookup
- Descriptive statistics
- Data visualization
- Information and insight generation
- Hypothesis testing (A/B testing)

Here is an example of what I do using spreadsheet:
  - [Case 1](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1jcHgtlt0jr78Qwenxm3v6D5ltf0rRJ-BebHOoKvPedA/edit#gid=420626643).
    - Background: In this project, I act as data analyst and looked at Luxura's e-commerce data for luxury fashion brands Adibi, Balena, and Celinna to figure out which one performed best.
    - Strategy: I did cleaning data and descriptive analytics to understand the data distribution and eliminate outliers using Google Sheets. Then, I compare each brand performances through EDA and statistical measurement. Lastly, using the analyzed data I gave insights and recommendations for the business problem.
    - Result: Celinna came out on top statistically, making the most revenue. So, I made my business recommendation and suggested Luxura to focus more on Celinna in the future, but still keep Adibi and Balena around through collaborations. I also recommended targeting marketing towards high-income young and middle-aged adults, and keeping track of performance with KPIs.
  - [Case 2](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1i5WUBfNMzLho2viyZ1N7qKF6kVyUKIaUpmGvgvNluDM/edit?usp=sharing).
    - Background: Based on case 1, I analyzed Luxura's e-commerce data to understand what influences the value of orders for the brand Adibi. Specifically, I wanted to predict how much a specific customer, Mr. Chu, spends on Adibi products given his income of $1.82 million and give insight and recommendation about his spending behavior.
    - Strategy: I looked at correlations between variables and used linear regression to create a formula for Adibi's order value. Then, I applied this formula to predict Mr. Chu's spending on Adibi products.
    - Result: I found that the value of Adibi orders is strongly correlated with Balena and Celinna order values, as well as Adibi promotions. Therefore, these variables couldn't be used for prediction. From the regression, I identified that Adibi order value is influenced by total order quantity, Adibi, Balena, and Celinna order quantities, and Balena order value. Based on Mr. Chu's spending behavior and the regression model, it turns out he spends only $348 on Adibi products. Therefore, I recommended that Mr. Chu not worry too much about his Luxura expenses since his spending on Adibi isn't significant.


### SQL skill sets:
I use Google BigQuery as my data manipulation software.
- Standard/basic query syntax
- Aggregate function
- Join table function
- Data type and datetime function

Here are some example of what I do using SQL:
  - Case 1: [A code on how to retrieves the count of delivered orders for each unique customer city between the specified date range](https://console.cloud.google.com/bigquery?sq=594081560594:1534bc1e2aa74c239ee83b722792d8cc).
    - Background: The task is to find the count of delivered orders for each unique customer city within a specific date range. This is done by joining the orders_dataset and customers_dataset on customer_id, grouping by city, and calculating order counts. The final output shows the top 100 cities with the highest order counts, sorted in descending order.
    - Strategy: The strategy involves joining datasets, grouping the data, and calculating order counts to obtain the count of delivered orders for each customer city.
    - Result: The result is a list showing the count of delivered orders for each unique customer city within the specified date range, sorted in descending order, with only the top 100 rows displayed.

  - Case 2: [A code on how to have counts of the number of delivered orders for each combination of city and month within the specified date range](https://console.cloud.google.com/bigquery?sq=594081560594:31c2e44c264d4d238bf7d46429c3aa44).
    - Background: Count how many orders were delivered for each city-month combination within a specified date range. Display the top 100 combinations with the lowest order counts.
    - Strategy: The strategy includes gathering the data, grouping it by city and month, and count orders for each combination, then sort in ascending order by order count and display the top 100 rows.
    - Result: The outcome is a list of order counts for each city-month combination within the specified date range, ordered in ascending order, with only the top 100 rows displayed.
    
  - Case 3: [A code on how to calculate the total number of distinct customers for each product category for delivered orders within a specific date range](https://console.cloud.google.com/bigquery?sq=594081560594:30c10230c8de482ba5088fbac10edd99).
    - Background: This task aims to calculate how many unique customers purchased from each product category within a specific date range. Join relevant datasets, group by product category, and count distinct customers. The final result is ordered in descending order by the total number of customers.
    - Strategy: The strategy includes performing left joins on relevant datasets, grouping by product category, and calculating the total number of distinct customers for each category, and the result sorted in descending order by the total number of customers.
    - Result: The result is a list showing the total number of distinct customers for each product category for delivered orders within the specified date range, ordered in descending order.


### Python skill sets:
I use Google Colaboratory as my data manipulation software.
- Data cleaning, including: changing data types, removing irrelevant values and duplicates, and removing or filling missing data
- Data manipulation, including: handling outlier(s) using IQR method, combine and merge datasets, and data aggregation
- Descriptive statistics
- Data visualization
- Hypothesis testing
- Cluster analysis

Here are some example of what I do using Python:
  - Case: [An analysis of a case study](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1BcvLki42I-j_qaNTCcWJ4GrZDBQakrMd?usp=sharing).
    - Background: RevoBank collaborated with Revoshop on a promotion for their credit card users, aiming to analyze promotion performance and optimize costs.
    - Strategy: The analysis involved data cleaning, exploration, and identifying promo-sensitive customers to evaluate promotion effectiveness. Clustering methods were then applied to segment users, followed by formulating business recommendations based on these segments.
    - Result: Insights revealed that 62% of total sales were from promoted transactions, but promotional costs were high, cutting into 54% of revenue. Around 67% of customers were promo-sensitive, with active users dominating e-commerce engagement. Clustering identified two main segments: promo-sensitive high spenders and promo-sensitive frequent purchasers. Recommendations included optimizing promotion costs by targeting both segments and offering targeted promotions for less-sensitive segments.


### Data visualization skill sets:
I use Tableau as my data visualization software.
- Connect and combine datasets
- Data formatting
- Making new column using calculated field/formula
- Data visualization, including but not limited to: making scorecard, heatmap table, stacked bar chart, and map
- Interactive dashboard

Here are some example of what I do using Tableau:
  - Case: An analysis of a case study, in which a video game distribution company wants to understand its customers by analyzing its sales performance. I am acting as data analyst of the company to understand the sales performance of the games sold in its app, looking for reviews of the games from the customers, and identify customer bases based on location.
    - Background: Steam aims to understand gaming trends, predict future patterns, and discern user demographics and preferences. Acted as a data analyst at Steam, I was tasked with providing insights to understand the current gaming ecosystem, predict future trends, and identify user demographics and preferences, by visualizing data into a comprehensive dashboard.
    - Strategy: Analyze gaming trends by examining sales performance, user reviews, and customer bases. Utilize metrics such as hours spent gaming, game ratings, purchase behavior, and user recommendations. Employ clustering techniques to segment users based on behavior and location.
    - Result: Insights revealed that paid games dominate the platform, indicating a need for regular promotions. Top games may suggest sequel potential or targeted promotions. Users spend an average of 108 gaming hours, with discounts potentially engaging less-active users. Each user purchases 290 products on average, showing potential for promotions. Total play hours exceed 614 million, reflecting platform popularity. Most users offer recommendations, aiding targeted marketing efforts. Strong user activity in Asia and America suggests localized marketing opportunities. Average game ratings at 77/100 indicate overall user satisfaction. Pricing and discount trends fluctuate over time, warranting targeted campaigns. Rating and price trends mirror each other, reflecting market dynamics. User behavior varies across segments, with promotions driving engagement. Recommendations include optimizing ratings, leveraging interactions, strategic pricing, regional marketing, and fostering loyalty. Advocating for data-driven decisions and regular metric monitoring are crucial.

This dashboard is filled with scorecards, simple statistics of the game sales performance, and a map representing the statistics of customer bases locations.  
      - This is the [part two](https://public.tableau.com/views/W9W10_SEP23_R_AbdullahReinhart_Sulaiman_intermediate_2/Dashboard2?:language=en-US&publish=yes&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link) of the two dashboards. This dashboard is filled with dual axis-line chart to represent growth over time and customer behavior across small groupings of customers.


### Project Based Analysis
With these skillsets, one must be able to put the skillsets into practice. This is my proof of work.
  - Case: [An analysis of a case study](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1rXe9kt3BZalKydsaFTcEmJKAWpoxcX8v?usp=sharing), in which I act as a data analyst of a market research company, to analyze the dataset of the e-commerce industry of a whole nation (Pakistan, using an actual public dataset) of a certain time range. The goal of the analysis is to understand how to increase revenue of those companies, by using datasets filled with data from multiple companies, and provide a comprehensive analysis, which then I offer insights and recommendations generated from the analysis.
    - Background: SparkTrend Analysis Co. aims to boost revenue in Pakistani e-commerce by analyzing transaction data from March 2016 to August 2018. The focus is on understanding sales trends, customer behaviors, and areas needing improvement.
    - Strategy: Utilize data cleaning, analysis, and visualization techniques to extract insights. I used Python and spreadsheet (Microsoft Excel) to do data cleaning and data analysis. Key areas of examination include popular product categories, payment methods, order statuses, and their impact on revenue. Uncover correlations and hidden patterns within the dataset. The data then visualized using Tableau.
    - Result: In the analysis, Mobiles and Tablets, Appliances, and Entertainment are the top earners, bringing in PKR 2.4 billion, PKR 634 million, and PKR 528 million respectively. However, Books, School and Education, and Health and Sports generate less, with PKR 2 million, PKR 5.4 million, and PKR 38.5 million respectively. Despite being popular, the top-selling categories also see significant losses in unsuccessful purchases. Cash-on-delivery is the preferred payment method, and most purchases are made without discounts. Peak purchase months are November 2016 and November 2017, with fiscal year 18 being the busiest. Refund and cancellation rates are notable at around 11.97% and 34.44% respectively, indicating room for improvement. Recommendations include targeted promotions, payment method optimization, resolving cancellation issues, and leveraging cross-selling opportunities to boost revenue and customer satisfaction. Additionally, suggestions include creating seasonal promotions, monitoring key performance indicators regularly, and staying adaptable to market shifts.
